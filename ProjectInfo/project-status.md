- GET: /api/calendar/lunar - API endpoint that returns JSON data for the Chinese lunar calendar

### Test Coverage
- Model tests: Verify properties and initialization
- Service tests: Verify lunar calendar conversion and calendar generation
- Controller tests: Verify endpoints, error handling, and API responses

### Project Configuration
- Added comprehensive .gitignore file to exclude:
  - Build artifacts (bin, obj folders)
  - IDE-specific files (.vs, .idea)
  - User-specific files (*.user)
